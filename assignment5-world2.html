                <p class="introduction">
                For far to long, have we Iranians suffered from how the government is running our country. 
                The plane crash that happened, is the last straw. We wont take any excuses, that the reason the plane crash happened was because of the tension between Iran and America.<br><br> 
                We have seen the way the government handled the situation, lying how the plane crash happened and brushing it off like it was nothing. We have had enough, stand together, Iranians!</p>

                A video on social media started to appear, where it showed what looked like a missile hitting the plane. This as we now know, appeared to be true.<br><br>
                Our Iranian government though, tried to deny this, by saying the crash happened because of engine failure, but after a few days, they had to come out with the truth, as the Canadian government started to find out the truth. 
                So that the Iranian government could save them selves and not look bad, they made an apology and said the truth.<br><br> If the government of Canada had not interfered, the Iranian's would have not got the real truth behind the plane crash. 
                It is despicable, that the Iranian government would want to hide the truth. Here is the video proof that started circuling around.</p>

                <p class="canada">The prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, is the one we have to thank for. He said he would not rest until the case obtained closure, transparency and justice. 
                He was also the one who suggested that the plane was shot down by Iranian missiles.<br><br> 
                Thanks to the pressure, the Iranian government had to come out and say the plane was brought down "unintentionally".</p>

            <h4 class=statement>The statement given by President Hassan Rouhani</h4>
                <p class="thoughts">
                The President has given his statement on the situation. Dare we say though, the statement is not enough to heal the wounds inflicted in our hearts. 
                The lives taken "unintentionally", could have been avoided if the government was patient enough. Having to take the blame on the situation against them and America, it is blatantly stupid.
